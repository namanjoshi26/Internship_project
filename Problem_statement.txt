There are 7 CSV files provided to us, they are described below:
? `train_data.csv`: It has a unique event `id` for each observation of the `outage_duration` in a particular `area_code`
? `test_data.csv`: Similar to the train dataset, we are provided with an `id` and an `area_code`, we are expected to predict the `outage_duration` for each of the records. (This will be provided to you later on 4th July)
? `broadband_data.csv`: For each of the event `id`s mentioned in the `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` files and also some additional `id`s there is a record of the `broadband_type` that is stored in the dataset. There are `10 different types` of broadbands that are observed in the dataset
? `outage_data.csv`: For each of the event `id`s mentioned in the `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` files and also some additional `id`s there is a record of the `outage_type` that is stored in the dataset. There are `5` different `outage_type`'s recorded in the dataset.
? `report_data.csv`: For each event `id` there are `log_report_type` and `volume` columns are recorded. `log_report_type` is a type of the recorded report generated by a technical team member after evaluating the outage. `volume` is the volume of data handled in the area at the time of report in custom company specific units.
? `server_data.csv`: For each of the event `id`s mentioned in the `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` files and also some additional `id`s there is a record of the `transit_server_type` that is stored in the dataset. Transit Servers handle the requests and responses of the customers.

The different `broadband_type`’s are given below:
{
broadband_type_8 : 'ADSL 1',
broadband_type_2 : 'ADSL 2',
broadband_type_6 : 'ADSL 2+',
broadband_type_7 : 'Cable',
broadband_type_4 : 'Fiber 1',
broadband_type_9 : 'BPL',
broadband_type_3 : 'Fiber 2',
broadband_type_10 : 'Fiber High Speed',
broadband_type_1 : 'Fiber Ultra',
broadband_type_5 : 'Fiber Ultra Max'
}
Description of the columns present in the dataset.
? `id` is the instance where the event was recorded when there was an outage in the broadband connectivity in an area ? `area_code` is a categorical column, in which each unique value refers to an area where the `outage_duration` has been measured ? `broadband_type` is the technology that the ISP uses for delivering broadband internet connection, there can be multiple types of broadband connections in a single area
? `outage_type` signifies the `5` different types of outages as classified by the engineering experts who remotely diagnose the issue, once reported ? The `log_report_type` column signifies one of the `386` different types of reports generated by customer service representatives who record issues and classify them as one of the 386 different types of issues ? `transit_server_type` is the type of transit server that handles the traffic of data and route the incoming and outgoing web traffic ? `volume` is the recorded data, in masked units, for 10 minutes prior to the time of recording the observation as per custom company specific units.

Objectives:
In this exercise, you are expected to:
1. Explore the data and engineer new features
2. Predict the `outage_duration‘ for records given in `test_data.csv` file
3. Answer questions from the operations team using EDA

Answering questions from the operations team:
The operations team at ‘India Broadband’ has asked you the following questions
? Which areas are most prone to long outage durations?
? Which broadband types are suspect of long outage durations?
? Any other recommendations to improve the detection of outage durations.
Evaluation Metric:
The evaluation metric used for this exercise would be the F1 Macro Average
